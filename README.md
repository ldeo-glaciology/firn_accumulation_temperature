# Firn compaction model with heat flow

Modification of this [model](https://github.com/ldeo-glaciology/firn_accumulation_model), with heat flow added. 

It sovles equations describing firn compaction, grain growth, heat flow, and age on an Eulerian grid using the model of lines. 

The addition of heat flow is a work in progress. 

The *python* directory contains a python version of the isothermal model (fcm.py).

All development is happening in the python directory.
